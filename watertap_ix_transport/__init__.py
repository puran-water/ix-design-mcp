WaterTAP Ion Exchange Transport Models

This package provides PHREEQC-based transport engines for ion exchange modeling.

Engines:
- DirectPhreeqcEngine: Direct PHREEQC TRANSPORT-based engine
- OptimizedPhreeqcEngine: Performance-optimized version (when available)

Features:
- Multi-component ion exchange with true thermodynamic modeling
- Direct PHREEQC integration for accurate breakthrough curves
- Support for various resin types and regenerants
