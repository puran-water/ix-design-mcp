## Key Economic Insights

### CAPEX Distribution (All Systems)
1. **Equipment: 40%** of total installed cost
   - Vessels: 16-22% (largest single item)
   - Pumps: 11-16% (oversized for reliability)
   - Resin: 1-2% (one-time fill)
   - Instrumentation: 5% (automation level)
2. **Installation: 60%** of total installed cost
   - Labor, piping, electrical, civil works
   - 2.5× equipment cost is typical for water treatment

### OPEX Distribution
1. **Waste Disposal: 60-70%** - Dominant cost driver
   - 6 bed volumes per regeneration
   - High disposal cost ($20/m³) for brine/acid waste
2. **Chemicals: 9-11%** - Moderate impact
   - HCl: $0.25/kg (32% solution)
   - NaCl: $0.10/kg (industrial grade)
   - NaOH: $0.42/kg (50% solution)
3. **Maintenance: 10-12%** - Standard 3% of CAPEX
4. **Power: 5-9%** - Relatively minor
5. **Labor: 5-8%** - 2 hrs/day operator attention

### Cost Drivers
1. **Vessel count** drives CAPEX (each vessel ~$150k installed)
2. **Waste disposal** dominates OPEX (60-70%)
3. **Na-WAC two-step regeneration** increases chemical cost
4. **Installation factor (2.5×)** doubles equipment cost

### Economic Optimization Opportunities
1. **Reduce waste volume** through regenerant reuse
2. **Optimize vessel sizing** to minimize count
3. **Negotiate waste disposal** contracts
4. **Consider on-site neutralization** for acid waste
5. **Automate operation** to reduce labor
