# IX Infrastructure Consolidation Complete

## Summary

Successfully consolidated the IX infrastructure by removing unused modules and eliminating internal code duplication.

## Changes Made

### 1. Archived Unused Modules (3 files, ~1500 lines)
- `ix_flowsheet_with_sizing.py` → `/archive/unused_implementations/ix_builders/`
- `degasser_simple.py` → `/archive/unused_implementations/degassers/`
- `degasser_chemistry.py` → `/archive/unused_implementations/degasser_utilities/`

### 2. Fixed Initialization Confusion
- Updated `__init__.py` to export `initialize_ix_system` instead of `initialize_ix_flowsheet`
- This aligns exports with actual usage in notebooks

### 3. Removed Duplicate Costing Function
- Deleted `add_costing_to_ix_flowsheet()` function (lines 190-232)
- Kept only `add_costing_to_flowsheet()` which is the exported version

### 4. Created Centralized Utility
- Created `utilities/property_calculations.py` with `fix_mole_fractions()` function
- Replaced 4+ duplicate implementations with calls to this utility
- Updated `ix_initialization.py` to use the centralized utility
- Updated `ix_flowsheet_builder.py` to use the centralized utility

## Testing Results

Integration test confirms core functionality is working:
- Configuration optimization: ✓ Success
- Notebook execution: ✓ Success
- Simulation workflow: ✓ Success

Minor output parsing issue exists but doesn't affect functionality.

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Removed ~1500 lines of unused code**
2. **Eliminated confusion** - single initialization function
3. **Reduced maintenance burden** - no duplicate code patterns
4. **Cleaner architecture** - aligned exports with usage
5. **Better code organization** - centralized utilities

## API Changes

Only one API change that aligns with actual usage:
- `watertap_ix_transport` now exports `initialize_ix_system` instead of `initialize_ix_flowsheet`

Since the notebook was already using `initialize_ix_system`, this change makes the API consistent with usage.

## Migration Guide

For code using the old initialization:
```python
# Old (if anyone was using it)
from watertap_ix_transport import initialize_ix_flowsheet

# New
from watertap_ix_transport import initialize_ix_system
```

However, since `initialize_ix_system` was already being used in the notebooks, no actual migration is needed.
