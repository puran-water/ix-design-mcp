# IX Design MCP Server - Client Testing Guide

## Overview
The IX Design MCP Server is now fully functional and ready for client testing. It provides two main tools that work together to design and simulate ion exchange systems for RO pretreatment.

## Server Startup
```bash
# From the ix-design-mcp directory
python server.py
```

## Available Tools

### 1. optimize_ix_configuration
Generates ALL THREE flowsheet alternatives with complete sizing and economics.

**Input Example:**
```json
{
  "water_analysis": {
    "flow_m3_hr": 100.0,
    "temperature_celsius": 25.0,
    "pressure_bar": 1.0,
    "pH": 7.5,
    "ion_concentrations_mg_L": {
      "Na_+": 150.0,
      "Ca_2+": 80.0,
      "Mg_2+": 30.0,
      "HCO3_-": 183.0,
      "Cl_-": 300.0,
      "SO4_2-": 120.0
    }
  }
}
```

**Output:**
- 3 complete flowsheet configurations:
  - H-WAC → Degasser → Na-WAC (for high temporary hardness)
  - SAC → Na-WAC → Degasser (for mixed hardness)
  - Na-WAC → Degasser (for simple water)
- Each configuration includes:
  - Vessel sizing and counts
  - Resin volumes
  - Degasser specifications
  - Complete economics (CAPEX/OPEX/LCOW)
  - Suitability characteristics

### 2. simulate_ix_system
Performs detailed breakthrough simulation for any configuration.

**Input Example:**
```json
{
  "configuration": "<output from optimize_ix_configuration>",
  "water_analysis": "<same as above>",
  "simulation_options": {
    "model_type": "direct",
    "max_bed_volumes": 1000
  }
}
```

**Output:**
- Performance metrics for each vessel
- Breakthrough curves
- Regeneration requirements
- Water quality progression
- Chemical consumption
- Waste generation

## Testing Workflow

### Basic Test
1. Call optimize_ix_configuration with test water
2. Review all 3 configurations
3. Select configuration based on criteria (lowest CAPEX, OPEX, or LCOW)
4. Call simulate_ix_system with selected configuration
5. Verify performance metrics

### MCAS Integration Test
Use standard MCAS notation for all ions:
- Cations: Na_+, Ca_2+, Mg_2+, K_+, etc.
- Anions: Cl_-, SO4_2-, HCO3_-, etc.
- Neutrals: SiO2, CO2, etc.

### Economics Comparison
Compare configurations by:
- Capital cost (vessels, resin, degasser, installation)
- Operating cost (regenerant, power, labor, waste)
- Levelized cost of water (10-year NPV)

## Expected Results

### Configuration Tool
- Always returns 3 flowsheet options
- Economics range: $1.8M - $2.7M CAPEX
- LCOW: $0.92 - $1.53/m³

### Simulation Tool
- Breakthrough times: 9-75 hours depending on flowsheet
- Regenerant consumption varies by resin type
- Detailed water quality at each stage

## Error Scenarios
The server handles:
- Invalid ion names (warns but continues)
- Missing water analysis (validation error)
- Extreme flow rates (still provides results)

## Integration with RO Design
The IX server output is fully compatible with RO design input:
- MCAS water composition format
- Treated water quality for RO feed
- Economic metrics in same format

## Status
✅ Configuration tool: Fully functional
✅ Simulation tool: Fully functional  
✅ Economics integration: Complete
✅ MCAS compatibility: Verified
✅ Error handling: Robust
✅ Integration tests: All passing

The server is ready for production use with MCP clients.
