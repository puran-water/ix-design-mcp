# MCP Server Fixes Documentation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Configuration Tool Hanging
**Problem**: The configuration tool would hang when first called, requiring forced stop and retry.

**Cause**: The `configure_sac_ix` async function was calling synchronous code directly, blocking the event loop.

**Solution**: Modified `server.py` to run synchronous functions in a thread executor:
```python
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
result = await loop.run_in_executor(None, configure_sac_vessel, sac_input)
```

### 2. OptimizedPhreeqcEngine Not Being Used
**Problem**: Despite initialization logs, DirectPhreeqcEngine was being used instead of OptimizedPhreeqcEngine.

**Cause**: Logic error - fallback code ran even after successful OptimizedPhreeqcEngine initialization.

**Solution**: Added early return in `sac_simulation.py` after successful initialization:
```python
if OPTIMIZED_AVAILABLE:
    try:
        self.engine = OptimizedPhreeqcEngine(...)
        logger.info("Using OptimizedPhreeqcEngine...")
        return  # Exit early, no fallback needed
```

### 3. Additional Improvements
- Added async handling to `simulate_sac_ix` function for better performance
- Added debug logging to track which engine is actually being used
- Both functions now properly handle long-running operations without blocking

## Verification
Test results show:
- Configuration completes instantly without hanging
- OptimizedPhreeqcEngine is properly initialized and used
- Async handling prevents event loop blocking
- Cache functionality is available (though effectiveness depends on input similarity)
